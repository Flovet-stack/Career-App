# CareerApp

Made with love by SevenAcademyStudents for Cameroon

The CareerApp project was built with the intention to allow students find out what is next, as per their careers.
The application serves data on the most in careers in Cameroon. Furthermore it provides a lot more of features to discover.

## Development server
The application consist of a backend and a frontend. The backend provides the data for the frontend.
To get the application up and running, you need to run `npm run server` at the root of the app. When that is done
cd into the frontend folder and run `npm run proxyStart`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
